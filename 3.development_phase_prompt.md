You're now moving into the next phase of the app development process. Your goal is to transform the initial project framework from Phase 2 into complete, production-quality code. Follow these guidelines:

## 1. Preparation
- Begin by reviewing the `masterplan.md` file, along with any provided diagrams or wireframes, and the foundational project structure created in Phase 2.
- For Stubbed out complete Project files Structure always refer `Project_Structure.md`
- To See Implementation steps and map with where we are in current stage of development based on user input, you can refer `Implementation_Steps.md`

## 2. Code Implementation
- Develop the full code for each foundational file with these standards:
  - Write production-grade code that meets the expectations of a senior developer.
  - Ensure the code is clean, organized, and easy to understand.
  - Make thoughtful decisions about the code's design and functionality.
  - Add comments to clarify complex logic or important design choices.

## 3. Clarify Requirements
- If any details are unclear or missing, ask the user for further information before proceeding with the implementation.

## 4. Core Functionality First
- Focus on implementing the essential features first.
- Include basic error handling and input validation where needed.

## 5. Third-Party Integrations and APIs
- For any third-party services or APIs mentioned in the master plan, implement them using your best judgment.

## 6. Database Operations
- Choose the most suitable methods for database operations and data management based on the project requirements.

## 7. Testing
- Avoid implementing extensive testing at this stage unless the user specifically requests it.

## 8. Performance and Scalability
- Don’t prioritize advanced optimizations for scalability or performance unless they are crucial for the app’s core functionality.

## 9. Security Considerations
- Implement security measures only if they are explicitly required as part of the core functionality in the master plan.

## 10. Document Your Work
- After completing each major component or feature:
  - Provide a concise summary of what was implemented.
  - Explain any significant design choices or assumptions.
  - Highlight any areas where you had to make critical decisions or interpret the requirements.

## 11. Be Ready to Explain
- Be prepared to show and discuss any part of the code if the user asks for further explanation.

## 12. Summarize the Implementation
- After completing the code:
  - Provide an overview of the features you’ve implemented.
  - Discuss any challenges faced and how they were resolved.
  - Offer suggestions for the next steps or areas that might benefit from further refinement.

## 13. Request Feedback
- Ask the user for feedback on the completed code and be ready to make adjustments as needed.

## Key Reminders
- Aim for code that is clean, efficient, and maintainable.
- Maintain consistency in coding style and naming conventions throughout the project.
- While aiming for a production-ready state, be open to further refinement based on feedback.
- Use your best judgment in any scenario not explicitly covered by these instructions, and explain your decisions to the user.

## Next Step
- Start by acknowledging that you're beginning this phase and ask the user if they’re ready to proceed with the complete code implementation based on the framework established in Phase 2.
