# AI-powered Custom Emoji Generator Masterplan

## Project Overview and Objectives

The AI-powered Custom Emoji Generator is a web application designed for YouTube content creators to generate custom emojis based on their channel's profile picture and selected emotions. The app aims to provide an easy-to-use interface for creating unique emojis that comply with YouTube's requirements for channel member emojis.

### Key Objectives:
1. Provide a user-friendly interface for generating custom emojis

3. Implement a tiered user system with free and premium options
4. Ensure generated emojis comply with YouTube's specifications

## Target Audience

- YouTube content creators
- Channel managers and social media teams
- Emoji enthusiasts

## Core Features and Functionality

1. User Authentication and Management
   - User registration and login using Clerk
   - Tiered user system (Free and Premium)
   - User profile management

2. Emoji Generation
   - Upload YouTube channel profile picture
   - Select emotion for the emoji
   - AI-powered emoji generation using FAL AI API
   - Preview and download generated emojis

3. Credit System
   - Free tier: 3 initial credits
   - Premium tier: Monthly credit allowance
   - Credit purchase option for free tier users

4. Emoji Management
   - Store generated emojis using UploadThing
   - Display user's generated emojis in dashboard
   - Public showcase of free tier emojis on landing page

5. User Interface
   - Responsive design using ShadcN UI components
   - Interactive elements with Framer Motion animations
   - Dark mode support

## High-Level Technical Stack Recommendations

1. Frontend:
   - Next.js (React framework)
   - TypeScript
   - Tailwind CSS
   - ShadcN UI (UI component library)
   - Framer Motion (animations)

2. Backend:
   - Next.js API routes
   - Node.js

3. Database:
   - PostgreSQL

4. Authentication:
   - Clerk

5. File Storage:
   - UploadThing

6. AI Integration:
   - FAL AI API (face-to-sticker model)

7. Deployment:
   - Vercel (for Next.js application)
   - Supabase (for PostgreSQL database)

## Conceptual Data Model

1. User
   - id (primary key)
   - clerkUserId (foreign key to Clerk user)
   - tier (enum: FREE, PREMIUM)
   - credits (integer)
   - createdAt (timestamp)
   - updatedAt (timestamp)

2. Emoji
   - id (primary key)
   - userId (foreign key to User)
   - imageUrl (string, UploadThing URL)
   - emotion (string)
   - isPublic (boolean)
   - createdAt (timestamp)
   - updatedAt (timestamp)

3. CreditPurchase
   - id (primary key)
   - userId (foreign key to User)
   - amount (integer)
   - cost (decimal)
   - createdAt (timestamp)

## User Interface Design Principles

1. Minimalist and clean design
2. Intuitive navigation and user flow
3. Responsive layout for various device sizes
4. Consistent use of ShadcN UI components
5. Smooth transitions and animations using Framer Motion
6. Accessible design following WCAG guidelines

## Security Considerations

1. Implement proper authentication and authorization using Clerk
2. Secure API routes with appropriate middleware
3. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. Use HTTPS for all communications
5. Properly handle and validate user inputs
6. Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
7. Implement proper error handling and logging
