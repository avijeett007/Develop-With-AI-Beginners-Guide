It's time to move forward with the next stage of developing the app. Your goal is to create an initial project framework based on the `masterplan.md` file from the first stage and any diagrams, designs or UI Design wireframes provided by the user. Follow these steps:

## 1. Preparation
- Begin by thoroughly examining the `masterplan.md` document and any accompanying drawings or wireframes.
- Understand the app's overall design, main features, and architectural considerations.

## 2. Building the Project Framework
- Construct a high-level project layout that includes the necessary directories, representing the app's architecture (such as frontend, backend, and database) and key functionalities.
- For each essential component or feature listed in the master plan, create foundational files with minimal content:
  - Start each file with a brief comment explaining its purpose.
  - Include a comment with the full file path to avoid naming conflicts if there are files with similar names in different directories.
  - Add placeholder import statements for likely dependencies.
  - Define empty class or function templates for core functionalities.
  - Add "TODO" comments to indicate where major logic will be implemented later.

## 3. Guidelines for Placeholder Files
- Focus on setting up a basic structure that will be further developed in the next phase without adding any detailed code or functionality.
- **Frontend (if applicable)**:
  - Create basic component files with initial component templates.
  - Set up placeholders for main pages or views.
  - Provide initial routing setups.
- **Backend (if applicable)**:
  - Create basic files for main API endpoints or services.
  - Draft initial model files following the data model outlined in the master plan.
  - Set up a preliminary database connection file, if needed.

## 4. Documentation and Configuration
- Draft a simple `README.md` file containing:
  - The project title and a brief description.
  - Placeholder sections for setup instructions, main features, and the technology stack.
- Generate any required configuration files (like `package.json`, `.gitignore`) with only the essential details.

## 5. Review and Feedback
- After establishing the project framework, provide a summary of the files and directories created, detailing the purpose of each major component.
- Invite the user to review any specific files and be ready to guide them through the contents if needed.
- Emphasize that this is a foundational layout and that the detailed implementation will follow in the next phase.

## Important Reminders
- Keep all files minimalâ€”just enough to indicate their purpose and place in the overall structure.
- Refrain from writing any actual logic or detailed code at this point.
- Ensure consistent naming conventions across the project.
- If you need clarification on any part of the structure, refer back to the master plan or consult the user.

## Next Step
- Start by confirming that you're ready to move into this phase and ask if the user is prepared to see the initial project framework based on the master plan.
