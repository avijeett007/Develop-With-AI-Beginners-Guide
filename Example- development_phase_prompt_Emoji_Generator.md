You're now moving into the next phase of the app development process. Your goal is to transform the initial project framework from Phase 2 into complete, production-quality code. Follow these guidelines:

## 1. Preparation
- Begin by reviewing the `masterplan.md` file, along with any provided diagrams or wireframes, and the foundational project structure created in Phase 2.
- For Stubbed out complete Project files Structure always refer `Project_Structure.md`
- To See Implementation steps and map with where we are in current stage of development based on user input, you can refer `Implementation_Steps.md`

## 2. Code Implementation
- Develop the full code for each foundational file with these standards:
  - Write production-grade code that meets the expectations of a senior developer.
  - Ensure the code is clean, organized, and easy to understand.
  - Make thoughtful decisions about the code's design and functionality.
  - Add comments to clarify complex logic or important design choices.

## 3. Clarify Requirements
- If any details are unclear or missing, ask the user for further information before proceeding with the implementation.

## 4. Core Functionality First
- Focus on implementing the essential features first.
- Include basic error handling and input validation where needed.

## 5. Third-Party Integrations and APIs
- For any third-party services or APIs mentioned in the master plan, implement them using your best judgment.

## 6. Database Operations
- Choose the most suitable methods for database operations and data management based on the project requirements.

## 7. Testing
- Avoid implementing extensive testing at this stage unless the user specifically requests it.

## 8. Performance and Scalability
- Don’t prioritize advanced optimizations for scalability or performance unless they are crucial for the app’s core functionality.

## 9. Security Considerations
- Implement security measures only if they are explicitly required as part of the core functionality in the master plan.

## 10. Document Your Work
- After completing each major component or feature:
  - Provide a concise summary of what was implemented.
  - Explain any significant design choices or assumptions.
  - Highlight any areas where you had to make critical decisions or interpret the requirements.

## 11. Be Ready to Explain
- Be prepared to show and discuss any part of the code if the user asks for further explanation.

## 12. Summarize the Implementation
- After completing the code:
  - Provide an overview of the features you’ve implemented.
  - Discuss any challenges faced and how they were resolved.
  - Offer suggestions for the next steps or areas that might benefit from further refinement.

## 13. Request Feedback
- Ask the user for feedback on the completed code and be ready to make adjustments as needed.

## Key Reminders
- Aim for code that is clean, efficient, and maintainable.
- Maintain consistency in coding style and naming conventions throughout the project.
- While aiming for a production-ready state, be open to further refinement based on feedback.
- Use your best judgment in any scenario not explicitly covered by these instructions, and explain your decisions to the user.

## Next Step
- Start by acknowledging that you're beginning this phase and ask the user if they’re ready to proceed with the complete code implementation based on the framework established in Phase 2.

Now Lets proceed with continuing step 8 of the implementation : Implement the public emoji showcase
Based on the plan here's what we need to do
- Create src/pages/showcase.tsx
- Implement src/pages/api/emoji/list.ts

please add or remove or modify any steps that is necessary and not given in this instruction.
However, we've already done most of the work already as currently landing page is already showing the FREE/public emojis.
I actually need help with few of the UI bug as below
- In the dashboard page, In the credit panel on the right side, the credit is not getting reduced when an emoji is generated. It should update/reduce live. However, now only after refresh its working. 
- In the dashboard page, your emoji section should only show if there is an emoji created by user previously, otherwise, it should show "You haven't created any emoji yet !!
- In the dashboard page, your emoji section, should show infinite moving slider where the previously created emoji's should show and slide to the next group (3 emoji at once should be visible)
- In the landing page, Created by Our Community section, should show infinite moving slider where the previously created public or free emoji's should show and slide to the next group (3 emoji at once should be visible). slider animation time of 1-2 sec.
